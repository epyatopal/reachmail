ReachMail API client library for node.js
========================================

reachmailnj aims to provide a simple client library for interacing with the
[ReachMail API](https://services.reachmail.net/documentation).

## Requirements

## Getting started

This is the preliminary version of the client library for node.js and as such

### Configure API

        var reachmail = require('/path/to/reachmailapi');

        var api = new reachmail({token: 'your_token_here'});

### Function parameters:

- get (service_url, callback())
- post (service_url, post_body, callback())
- put (service_url, post_body, callback())
- delete (service_url, callback())

        api.get('/administration/users/current', 
                function (http_code, response) {
            console.log(http_code);
            console.log(response);
